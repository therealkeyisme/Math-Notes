\section{General Theory of Homogeneous Linear Equations}
  The standard form for a general second order ordinary differential equation is

  \begin{equation}
    x''(t)+p(t)x'(t)+q(t)x(t)=f(t).
  \end{equation}
  
  For us, $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ are typically going to be constants. Also we know that if $f(t)=0$, the equation is homogenous.

  \begin{lemma}
    GGiven an equation in the form 

    \begin{equation}
      x''(t)+p(t)x'(t)+q(t)x(t)=0,
    \end{equation}

    if $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$ are solutions to equation (3.2), then 

    \begin{equation}
      x(t)=C_1x_1(t)+C_2x_2(t)
    \end{equation}

    is also a solution to equation (3.1) for all $C_1,C_2$'s. Equation (3.3) is the general solution to a homogeneous ODE
  \end{lemma}

  Let's take a look at an application of lemma (3.1.1).

  \begin{problem}
    Consider the equation

    \begin{equation}
    t^2x'''+2tx''-6x'=0.
    \end{equation}

    This equation is a third order, linear and homogeneous, but not autonomous ordinary differential equation. Let's put this differential equation into standard form:

    \begin{equation}
    x''+\frac{2}{t}x''+\frac{6}{t^2}x'=0
    \end{equation}

    As long as $t_0\neq0$, we have a unique solution if given 3 initial conditions. The domain of this ordinary differential equation is $t>0,t<0$. Earlier, in section 3.1, we showed that $1,t^3,\frac{1}{t^2}$ were all solutions. Because this ordinary differential equation is linear and homogeneous, we know that 

    \begin{equation}
    x(t)=C_11+C_2t^3+C_3\frac{1}{t^2},
    \end{equation}

    is also a solution for all $C_1,C_2,C_3$. Just note, equation (3.6) is a linear combination of $1,t^3,\frac{1}{t^2}$. So, this is a \underline{general solution} as long as the functions, $1,t^3,\frac{1}{t^2}$ are all “different” from each other.
  \end{problem}

  What is "different"? Different means no one function in a set can be written as a linear combination of other functions in the set. Different means that all of the functions are linearly independent. More generally, if 

  \begin{equation}
    C_1f_1(t)+C_2f_2(t)+\dots+C_nf_n(t)=0
  \end{equation}

  \begin{theorem}
    WWe can instead test for linear independence by using the wronskian,

    \begin{equation}
      w(f_1,f_2)(t)=det\begin{vmatrix}
        f_1(t)&&f_2(t)\\f'_1(t)&&f'_2(t)\\
      \end{vmatrix}
    \end{equation}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item If $w(t)=0$ for all $t$'s, then $\{f_1,f_2\}$ are linearly dependent.
      \item If $w(t)=0$ for all $t$'s, then $\{f_1,f_2\}$ are linearly independent.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{theorem}

  Now, if we try to use the wronskian on problem 16, we do it like so:

  \begin{align}
    w(t)=
    \begin{vmatrix}
      1&&t^3&&\frac{1}{t^2}\\
      0&&3t^2&&-\frac{2}{t^2}\\
      0&&6t&&\frac{6}{t^4}\\
    \end{vmatrix}\\
    \to 1\times
    \begin{vmatrix}
      3t^2&&-\frac{2}{t^2}\\
      6t&&\frac{6}{t^4}\\
    \end{vmatrix}\\
    =\frac{18}{t^2}+\frac{12}{t^2}=\frac{30}{t^2}\neq0
  \end{align}

  So we know that $\{1,t^3,\frac{1}{t^3}\}$ are linearly independent. 

  Let's consider another problem where we need to show that the solutions are linearly dependent.

  \begin{problem}
    Let's consider the equation $y''(x)=-9y$, which has the solutions $\{\cos(3x),\sin(3x)\}$ and let's show that the two solutions are linearly independent:

  \begin{equation}
    w(x)=\begin{bmatrix} \cos(3t)&\sin(3t)\\-3\sin(3t)&3\cos(3t) \end{bmatrix}
    =3\cos^2(3x)+3\sin^2(3x)=3\neq0
  \end{equation}
  
  Which means that both solutions are valid for this ordinary differential equation. We can turn our original equation into $y''(x)+9y=0$ which is a homogeneous ordinary differential equation. Our $p(x)=0$, and because we know that $w(x)=Ce^{-\int p(x)dx}$, we know that the solution to our equation is 0.
  \end{problem}

  \begin{theorem}
    What to we do when solving linear non-homogeneous ordinary differential equations?
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Solve the associated homogeneous ODE $\to X_h(t)$, which will have many unknown constants
      \item Find one solution to nonhomogeneous ODE $\to X_p(t)$
    \end{enumerate}

    The general solution to the original nonhomogeneous ODE is 

    \begin{equation}
      x(t)=x_h(t)+x_p(t)
    \end{equation}
  \end{theorem}

  Let's try out this new theorem on an example problem.

  \begin{problem}
    Consider the differential equation $y''-5y'-6y=4x$. We claim that 

    \begin{equation}
      y(x)=c_1e^{-x}+c_2e^{6x}-\frac{2}{3}+\frac{5}{9}
    \end{equation}

    Are $\{e^{-x},e^{6x}\}$ linearly independent? Verify both solutions to equation (3.14).

    \begin{align}
      w(x)&=\begin{bmatrix} e^{-x}&e^{6x}\\-e^{-x}&6e^{6x} \end{bmatrix} \\
          &=6e^{5x}+e^{5x}=7e^{5x}
    \end{align}

    Now we need to verify that this is a solution:

    \begin{align}
      y'(x)&=-C_1e^{-x}+6C_2e^{6x}-\frac{2}{3}\\
      y''(x)&=C_1e^{-x}+36C_2e^{6x}
    \end{align}

     Let's see if the left hand side is equal to $4x$ like it was above.

     \begin{align*}
       y''-5y'-6y=\left[C_1e^{-x}+36C_2e^{6x}\right]&-5\left[-C_1e^{-x}+6C_2e^{6x}-\frac{2}{3}\right]\\
                                                    &-6\left[C_1e^{-x}+C_2e^{6x}-\frac{2}{3}+\frac{5}{9}\right]
     \end{align*}
     \begin{align*}
       &=C_1[e^{-x}+te^{-x}-6e^{-x}]+C_2[36e^{6x}-30e^{6x}-6e^{6x}]+\left[\frac{10}{3}+4x-\frac{10}{3}\right]\\
       &=0+0+4x
     .\end{align*}

  \end{problem}
