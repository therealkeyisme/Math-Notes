\section{Mimimization and Least Squares}

\begin{theorem}
  If $K$ is a positive definite (and hence symmetric) matrix, then the quadratic function has a unique minimizer, whcih is the solution to the linear system 
  \[
  Kx=f,\text{ namely } x^{*}=K^{-1}f
.\] The minimum value of $p(x)$ is equal to any of the following expressions: \[
p(X^{*})=p(K^{-1}f)=c-f^{T}K^{-1}f=c-f^{T}x^{*}=c-(x^{*})^{T}Kx^{*}
.\] 
\end{theorem}
